# Dynamic-Pricing
This project focuses on building a dynamic pricing strategy for an e-commerce platform using historical sales data. The objective is to model price elasticity, simulate demand responses to price changes, and identify profit-maximizing prices at the SKU and category levels.
# How to Run the Code
  -Place the sales CSV file as data.csv in the project directory.
  -Run the Python script:
          python dynamic_pricing_analysis.ipynb

  The script will:

  -Clean and preprocess the data.

  -Plot demand curves and fit a log-linear model.

  -Simulate profits across price points.

  -Print elasticity estimates and revenue comparisons.

  -Display profit/revenue plots for decision-making.
